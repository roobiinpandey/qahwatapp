# 🔧 APK Crash Fix - MainActivity ClassNotFoundException

## 📋 Problem Summary

The app was immediately crashing on startup with the following error:
```
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Didn't find class "com.qahwat.alemarat.MainActivity"
```

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

1. **Package Structure Mismatch**: The MainActivity was located in `com.example.qahwat_al_emarat` but the app was configured for `com.qahwat.alemarat`
2. **Debug Build Suffix**: Debug builds had `applicationIdSuffix = ".debug"` which changed the package name to `com.qahwat.alemarat.debug`
3. **Missing Package Declaration**: AndroidManifest.xml was missing the explicit package declaration

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed AndroidManifest.xml
**File**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.qahwat.alemarat">
```

### 2. Fixed Package Structure
**Created**: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/qahwat/alemarat/MainActivity.kt`
```kotlin
package com.qahwat.alemarat

import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterActivity

class MainActivity : FlutterActivity()
```

### 3. Fixed Debug Build Configuration
**File**: `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
debug {
    // Debug configuration
    isDebuggable = true
    // Removed: applicationIdSuffix = ".debug"
}
```
