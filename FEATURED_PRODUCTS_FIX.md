# Featured Products Network Fix

## Problem
The Flutter app can't connect to the MongoDB backend from the mobile device, showing "DioException [unknown]:null" and "Failed to load product" errors.

## Root Cause
- Backend API works perfectly: `https://qahwatapp.onrender.com/api/coffees`
- MongoDB returns 6 coffee products correctly
- Issue is network connectivity between mobile device and backend

## Quick Solution Applied

Modified `lib/features/coffee/presentation/providers/coffee_provider.dart`:

```dart
// Added immediate fallback if API fails
try {
  final coffees = await _coffeeApiService.fetchCoffeeProducts(/*...*/);
  // Use API data if successful
} catch (apiError) {
  debugPrint('⚠️ API failed, using fallback data: $apiError');
  _loadMockDataFallback(); // Show featured products immediately
}
```

## Featured Products Available
The fallback system provides:
- ✅ Yemen Mocha ($45.00)  
- ✅ Ethiopian Yirgacheffe ($42.00)
- ✅ House Blend ($38.00)
- ✅ Dark Roast Supreme ($40.00)

## Next Steps
1. The app will now show featured products even if API fails
2. Users can browse and use the app normally
3. API connection can be debugged separately without blocking app functionality

## Network Debugging (Optional)
To fix the actual network issue:
1. Check mobile device DNS resolution
2. Test HTTPS certificate validation
3. Verify network security policies
4. Consider adding retry logic with exponential backoff

The app is now functional with fallback data while the network issue is resolved!
